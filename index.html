        <p class="lead mb-4">Throughout the years I have had a couple of jobs that have taught me different things, and have prepared me to work in a fast-paced place. The jobs would consist of working with my mom, working at a pizza parlor, working at my university, etc. I am currently working at my university as a crew member. I started around November or December of 2021, so I have not been working for my university for long. I have earned a nice amount but was with no job for a couple of weeks due to winter break and catching COVID. I never have a set job title and or place of work, so it all differentiates depending on what I am scheduled for. At times I am on Savor Line, which is just asking people what they would prefer then putting it on their plates. Or I am DRO which is just taking care of drinks and sweeping/sanitizing the place where people are eating. I am an assistant at the market, so I would typically just restock items throughout the store and make sure everything is in its respectable place. A dishwasher which is pretty straightforward and lastly I can be a janitor for either Savor or for The Market and I just clean the restrooms, I clean after people and frequently sanitize everything. 
<br><br>

        Before working for Savor at my university, I was working for a pizza place that is widely known as Little Caesars. I began working for Little Caesars prior to my senior year and during the crazy pandemic, so it was August or September of 2020. While working for Little Caesars I was in different stations throughout my shifts, but for the most part, I was a cashier. Being a cashier was pretty easy, the only difficult times were when I had to deal with customers who had become angry for numerous reasons. It would slow down the fast-paced environment we had and it was mildly difficult to come to an understanding but I had always tried my best to make the customer leave happy. If I wasn't working, I would be doing carts full of dough and putting the dough in pans to flatten them out, putting toppings on the pizzas, cleaning, or being on landing. The landing was just cutting the pizzas, putting the respectable tags on them, and packaging them up for the customers. <br><br>

        Prior to having any part-time jobs, I would work with my mother. I can't recall when I started working with my mother, but I know for a fact that I had started at a young age, probably around 11 or 12. My mother and I would typically be cleaning either homes, offices, etc., and would have to be cleaned in under 3 hours. I didnâ€™t do much, my mom would have me do the easy things while sheâ€™d get the difficult things done. I would either clean toilets, mirrors, vacuum, etc. It wasnâ€™t anything too hard and it prepared me for the jobs I had/currently have.
